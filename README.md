## Usage

You can now consume the action by referencing the available version.

```yaml
uses: thiagodnf/yaml-schema-checker@v0.0.11
with:
  jsonSchemaFile: schemas/example.schema.json
  yamlFiles: folder/subfolder/**/*.yml
```

or you can use combine patterns and files as array:

```yaml
uses: thiagodnf/yaml-schema-checker@v0.0.11
with:
  jsonSchemaFile: schemas/example.schema.json
  yamlFiles: |
    file_1.yml,file_2.yml # two files in the same line
    file_3.yml
    folder/subfolder/**/*.yml
```

This project uses [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) to read files

## Input

### `jsonSchemaFile`

**Required** A JSON schema file following the format used at https://www.schemastore.org

### `yamlFiles`

**Required** A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to be validated


### `filesSeparator`

**Optional** Separator used to split the files input. Default is `,` (comma).

## Outputs

### `validFiles`

Comma separated list of files that passed

### `invalidFiles`

Comma separated list of files that failed

## Log

If you run this GitHub Actions, this is what the log information looks like:

```bash
Run thiagodnf/yaml-schema-checker@v0.0.11
Json Schema: schemas/example.schema.json

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications for free! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, reach out to me if you want to do it.

Thanks!
